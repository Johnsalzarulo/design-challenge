# Design challenge

### Preface
This is a real-world sample of a design challenge our agency has faced. It's intended to let you see a tiny sample of the kind of work the job has. We aren’t asking for free work. We’ve already got a solution live to this in production. There is no expectation of pixel perfect mockups. We are trying to get a good idea of how you think as a designer and how you collaborate. We value your skill, taste and ability to self direct and do the work over anything else.

### Challenge

Hey Designer! 

I am one of your fellow team-members at better. I am a developer working on a form for an application process. In this application potential participants are signing up to hopefully be approved for a health improvment program. I attached a screenshot of the current prototype, I outlined some of my challenges below and I would love your thoughts on it. 

- The project manager already confirmed with the client that every field on this form is required, we can't cut down the questions at all.
- I am attempting to adapt this to mobile and it's nearly unusable. 
- I am trying to figure out how to best handle error states, for example: the email used to sign up must be uniqe and handling this validation with the noise of the form is difficult. 
- Overall this user expereince is just really frustrating, do you have any thoughts on how to improve it? 
- What about aestetics? How do you think this form looks? Is there anything we can do to make it feel more complete and polished? 
- Can you advise an action plan to improve this form? **Bonus points if there's sample mockups or sketches allthough not required.**

### To send in a submission

Ideally you can just open an issue in this repository, treat it as an open project, our team will collaborate with you to refine the concepts. If you want to get clarification on a challenge or a specific point just open an issue and ask! We'd love to work together to think through this design problem. We can both get a feel for eachother in the process. **Alternatively, If you would prefer to have a private submision you can email it to john@withbetter.com** - please treat it in the same way, an open design challenge we are collaborating on.
