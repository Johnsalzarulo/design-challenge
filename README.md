# Design challenge

### Preface
This is a real-world sample of a design challenge our agency has faced. It's intended to let you see a tiny sample of the kind of work the job has. We aren’t asking for free work. We’ve already got a solution live to this in production. There is no expectation of pixel perfect mockups. We are trying to get a good idea of how you think as a designer and how you collaborate. We value your skill, taste and ability to self direct and do the work over anything else.

### Challenge

Hey Designer!

Pretend I one of your fellow team-members at better. I am a developer working on a form for an application process. In this application potential participants are signing up for a health improvement program. I attached a screenshot of the current prototype below. I outlined some of my challenges below and I would love your thoughts on it.

- The project manager already confirmed the client requires every field on this form. We can't cut down the questions at all.
- I am attempting to adapt this to mobile and it's unusable.
- I am trying to figure out how to best handle error states. Example: the email used to sign up must be unique. Handling this validation with the complexity of the form is difficult.
This user experience is frustrating, do you have any thoughts on how to improve it?
- What about aesthetics? How do you think this form looks? Is there anything we can do to make it feel more complete and polished?
- Can you outline an action plan to improve this form? 
- **Bonus points if there's sample mockups or sketches although not required.**

### The Form in Question:

### To send in a submission

Ideally, you can open an issue in this repository. Treat it as an open project, our team will collaborate with you to refine the concepts. If you want to get clarification on a challenge or a specific point open an issue and ask! We'd love to work together to think through this design problem. We can both get a feel for each other in the process. 

**Although we prefer a public submission - we understand that couple be akward if you are currently employed. If that's the case you can email your submission to john@withbetter.com - please treat it in the same way, an open design challenge we are collaborating on.**
